# 🧮 Mini Math Challenge Game (C)

A console-based math quiz game developed in C that challenges users with randomly generated arithmetic problems. The game evaluates performance based on difficulty level, calculates scores, and stores past results for progress tracking.

This project demonstrates core C programming concepts including structures, unions, file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and menu-driven program design.
